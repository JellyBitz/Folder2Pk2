Import entire folder content right into the .pk2 file with the same folder name.
All this with just drag and drop the folder into the application.

### Features

- Import files and folders
- `GFXFileManager.dll` is no longer required

### Usage
Put the application inside the client path and just drag and drop the folder you want to import into the application.  

Or use the command line to make your setup quicker:
```
Folder2Pk2 "-client=C:\Games\Silkroad\" "-key=169841"
```

`-client=` : Path to the client to import the folder  
`-key=` : Encryption key used by the .pk2 file
